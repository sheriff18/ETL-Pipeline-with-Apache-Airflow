Project Overview: 
ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines are essential for moving data from various sources to a centralized data warehouse. Apache Airflow is a workflow management tool that can be used to schedule and manage ETL pipelines.

Steps Involved:
Data Extraction: Extract data from various sources such as databases, APIs, or flat files.
Data Transformation: Clean, transform, and enrich the data according to business requirements using Python scripts or SQL transformations.

Data Loading: 
Load the transformed data into a data warehouse like Amazon Redshift or Google BigQuery.
Workflow Management: Use Airflow to schedule, monitor, and manage the entire ETL process, including setting up dependencies, retries, and alerts.

Skills Gained:
Mastery of Apache Airflow for orchestrating complex workflows.
Experience with ETL processes, including data extraction, transformation, and loading.
Familiarity with cloud data warehouses like Redshift or BigQuery.

Use Case:
This project is valuable for organizations that need to automate the integration of data from multiple sources into a single, accessible repository for analytics and reporting.
